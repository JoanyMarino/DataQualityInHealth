## Proposal section 1: Scope

**Requirement**: Include one or two paragraphs about the scope of the task view, outlining the inclusion and exclusion criteria
  as well as relevant sections within the topic.
  *A task view should be on a topic with a rather clear scope that should neither be too narrow nor too wide.*
  
DataQualityInHealth contains packages that help assessing the fitness for use / data quality 
of medical data. 

The Package list is divided in two major sections: Packages that address
R programmers and packages that also address users with limited programming skills.
Also, there are sections related to sub-tasks of data quality assessments, i.e. to data integrity,
data completeness, data consistency and data accuracy (@schmidt2021).

**To do**: 

- [ ] Add inclusion and exclusion criteria.
- [ ] Explain the necessity of a narrow scope for this task view.
- [ ] Rewrite according to the structure of the list of packages.
