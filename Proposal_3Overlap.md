## Proposal section 3: Overlap

**Requirement**: Comment on potential overlap with already existing task views as well as with task views that might be
  created (or split off) in the future.

Data quality assessment and monitoring are included in other task views only to a lesser extent. Some views list specific applications, for example, hydrological data quality in the Hydrology task view. The MissingData task view reviews data completeness and imputation in detail, which we consider a part of a data quality assessment. Similarly, quality inspection during general data processing is addressed in the OfficialStatistics task view but limited to assertion checking packages. We aim to minimize overlap with these broad task views by concentrating on observational health data. A potential overlap with a focus on medical data would be the ClinicalTrials task view. Nevertheless, this task view involves the design, monitoring and analysis of clinical trials in a general way, and the data monitoring and analysis sections do not yet include quality assessment. 

**To do**: 

- [x] How do we minimize overlap? - We also hint at this in the scope section
- [x] Why does the existing overlap does not imply redundancy?
- [x] Check if any of our packages is already included in another task view? - Only in OfficialStatistics and MissingData
