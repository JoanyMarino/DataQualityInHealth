## Instructions

* _Submission:_ [Open an issue](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/issues) in the `ctv` repository with the title
   _CRAN task view proposal: MyTopic_ where _MyTopic_ should be replaced with the intended name of the task view in
   _CamelCase_.

1. _Scope:_ Include one or two paragraphs about the scope of the task view, outlining the inclusion and exclusion criteria
  as well as relevant sections within the topic.
  
2. _Packages:_ Include a _tentative list_ of packages for the task view. This should encompass the "core" packages
  and a collection of relevant packages, ideally grouped by sections within the topic. It is not important, yet,
  that the list of sections or packages is already exhaustive. *Here, we will link to the README.md to give a  
  preview of the task view as it would appear once accepted with the list of packages*.
  
3. _Overlap:_ Comment on potential overlap with already existing task views as well as with task views that might be
  created (or split off) in the future.
  
4. _Maintainers:_ The proposal should be made by the person willing to act as the principal maintainer for the task view.
  Furthermore, task views should have teams of additional 1-5 co-maintainers and possible candidates for these can be listed
  as well in the proposal.

   
All sections of the proposal have been divided into separate files (Proposal_*.md) to facilitate simultaneous collaboration. 

**To do** (once we are ready to submit): 

- [ ] Merge the three Proposal_*Packages.md into the README.md.
- [ ] Create an issue with Proposal_*.md sections 1, 2, and 4.
- [ ] Remove old files / move to another repository.
