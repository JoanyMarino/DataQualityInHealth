The assessment of data quality in observational health studies has received increasing attention over the past years, 
and a range of tools has been developed to facilitate data quality assessments in R. 
This task view contains information about packages relevant to assuring data quality in the health sciences. 

The packages listed in this task view are undergoing rapid development, and new ones are being continuously released.
To keep the list up-to-date, we welcome and acknowledge suggestions for additions or improvements.

If you can't contribute on GitHub, please send an email to the mantainers listed above. 
If you have an issue with one of the packages discussed below, please contact
the maintainer of that package. 


### Core tools for data quality assessments

-   `r pkg("dataquieR", priority = "core")`: dataquieR is designed to conduct data quality assessments in data collections for research. 
     It makes strong use of metadata (e.g. collected in spreadsheets) and checks the formal compliance of study data with expectations defined in the metadata. 
     The data quality assessments cover the dimensions completeness, consistency, and accuracy, as proposed by the framework of Schmidt et al. (2020). 
     For technical details see Richter et al. (2021).
