_**Work in Progress**_: Please see [Proposal_0Instructions.md](Proposal_0Instructions.md).

The assessment of data quality in observational health studies has received increasing attention over the past years, 
and a range of tools has been developed to facilitate data quality assessments in R. 
This task view contains information about packages relevant to assuring data quality in the health sciences. 

The packages listed in this task view are undergoing rapid development, and new ones are being continuously released.
To keep the list up-to-date, we welcome and acknowledge suggestions for additions or improvements. 
To do so, please send your comments in GitHub by
[submitting an issue](https://github.com/cran-task-views/DataQualityHealth/issues),
or make some edits and
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/cran-task-views/pulls).
If you can't contribute on GitHub, please send an email to the mantainers listed above. 
If you have an issue with one of the packages discussed below, please contact
the maintainer of that package. 


### Packages 

Old classification:

1. Core tools for data quality assessments
2. Tools that assist in data quality assessments
3. Tools that provide a GUI for non-programmers

New classification (maybe in reverse order?):

1. Packages that focus on descriptive overviews and on data exploration.
2. Packages that require an input of rules to perform a series of highly focused checks.
3. Packages that combine a broad range of descriptive features with the possibility to perform targeted checks.
